Kill the PC-engine plugin's telemetry channels (GameHub 6.1.1).

Two channels live in the downloaded PC-engine plugin rather than the base APK,
so apply_privacy_patches.py cannot reach them. Both are stubbed here and shipped
through the shadow dex.

=== CHANNEL 1: device-performance session summary ==========================

6.0.9 had a device-performance channel that apply_privacy_patches.py stubbed at
Lqv4;->b. On 6.1.1 that endpoint is absent from the BASE APK, which made it look
retired — it was not. It moved into the downloaded PC-engine plugin and got a
successor. Device logs from STOCK 6.1.1 show, per game session:

  DevicePerformanceReporter session start sessionId=<uuid> gameId=… sourceGameId=…
  DevicePerformanceReporter summary sample captured … fps=59 pwr=1.93 ramMb=1667
      ramPercent=15.0 ramTotalMb=11113.258 gpuPercent=4        (every ~10 s)
  DevicePerfSessionSummaryUploader upload start batchSize=1 sessionIds=[…]
      payloadBytes=878 payloadPreview=[{"event_type":"device_perf_session_summary",
      "user_id":…
  DevicePerfSessionSummaryUploader upload success batchSize=1

and log `summaryOnly=true legacyUpload=false`, i.e. the OLD endpoint is disabled
and this replaced it. So a per-session hardware/performance profile tied to a
user id and game id leaves the device on every play session.

Patched:
  Lxjp/mv1;->c(JLkotlin/coroutines/jvm/internal/ContinuationImpl;)Ljava/lang/Object;

That is the uploader: it is the unique method in Lxjp/mv1; that builds the
"upload start" log lambda Lxjp/hv1;, and Lxjp/mv1;->b(IJ…) (the bootstrap/retry
wrapper) delegates to it — so one stub covers both entry points.

We early-return `new Lxjp/jv1;()` — the host's OWN "nothing was uploaded" result,
which it already constructs at three bail-out sites in this very method (empty
batch, missing summary, upload failure). Callers therefore see a shape they
already handle: the reporter logs `uploadedBatches=0` and moves on. Sampling
still runs and summaries are still written to local storage; nothing is sent.

Related plugin classes, for future re-anchoring:
  Lxjp/bv1;  DTO (serialName device_perf_session_summary)
  Lxjp/gv1;  repository (device_perf_session_summary_v1, readSummaryLocked)
  Lxjp/hv1;  "upload start" log lambda      Lxjp/iv1;  "upload success" lambda
  Lxjp/jv1;  uploader result (fields a:Z, b:Set; synthetic no-arg ctor)

=== CHANNEL 2: playtime heartbeat (leaks the user's Steam ID64) ============

Confirmed live on stock 6.1.1: with a game running, the :pcengine process POSTs
https://landscape-api-oversea.vgabc.com/heartbeat/game/update every 30 seconds
with params

  game_id=…&source_game_id=…&source_type=1&source_user_id=76561197968189945

where source_user_id is the user's real Steam ID64. heartbeat/game/start and
heartbeat/game/end fire around it. The base-APK stub (Lvho;->a) only covers a
base-APK heartbeat *start*; the plugin carries its own start/update/end trio.

Owner: Lxjp/kx9; = WineGameUsageTracker (getValue() returns that literal;
local MMKV key prefix "wine_usage:" built in d()). Its methods are NOT the
senders — that mattered, because the audit's start/update/end mapping was
unconfirmed. Read out of the smali:

  Lxjp/kx9;->a(Lxjp/kx9;,Cont)  builds the request DTO `new Lxjp/fs9;(Integer,
      String, String, String)` = (game_id, source_game_id, source_type,
      source_user_id). Not a sender.
  Lxjp/kx9;->b(Cont)  memoises field Z from Lxjp/ap2;->e — the source_user_id
      used when source_type == "2".
  Lxjp/kx9;->c(Cont)  memoises field X from Lxjp/ty6;->a:J — the source_user_id
      used when source_type == "1", i.e. THE Steam ID64 seen on the wire.
  Lxjp/kx9;->d()     sha256("wine_usage:"+a+":"+b) — the local MMKV key.
  Lxjp/kx9;->e(String,Cont)  packed-switch on source_type: "1"->c(), "2"->b(),
      "3"->"". So e() is the id RESOLVER, not a network call.
  Lxjp/kx9;->f()     session stop: cancels the heartbeat Job (field A), then
      accumulates elapsed seconds into MMKV.

The three POSTs live in the tracker's suspend lambdas, each of which builds the
DTO via kx9->a() and then hands it to ONE shared HTTP bridge:

  Lxjp/uk8;->invokeSuspend  const-string "heartbeat/game/start"   -> jg4->e(...)
  Lxjp/x06;->invokeSuspend  const-string "heartbeat/game/update"  -> jg4->e(...)
  Lxjp/gx9;->invokeSuspend  const-string "heartbeat/game/end"     -> jg4->e(...)

(Lifecycle, read from Lxjp/wv9;: on session start it launches Lxjp/x06;(kx9,
null,0x18) when kx9->q is set else Lxjp/uk8;(kx9,null), then launches
Lxjp/gx9;(kx9,null,1) into kx9->A — that is the `while (isActive) { delay(0x7530
= 30_000 ms); launch x06(update); accumulate MMKV }` loop, which matches the
observed 30 s cadence. Lxjp/gx9; with selector 0 is the end POST, reached from
kx9->f() via Lxjp/l86;.)

WHAT THIS PATCHES

  Lxjp/jg4;->e(Lxjp/jg4;Ljava/lang/String;Lxjp/fs9;
               Lkotlin/coroutines/jvm/internal/SuspendLambda;)Ljava/lang/Object;

That is the single funnel for all three beats: an R8-synthesised static bridge
that supplies the default request-config block (Lxjp/k3;(0xb)) and delegates to
the generic POST helper Lxjp/jg4;->d(...). Two independent facts make it the
right anchor rather than the URL-literal holders:

  * its third parameter is typed Lxjp/fs9; — the heartbeat DTO, which exists for
    nothing else in the plugin (Lxjp/ds9;/Lxjp/es9; are just its serialiser and
    Companion);
  * tree-wide it has exactly THREE call sites, one per heartbeat path, and every
    caller file carries exactly one heartbeat/game/* literal. assert_heartbeat_
    funnel() re-checks that at patch time, so a future plugin that routes some
    other endpoint through e() fails the build instead of silently losing it.

Lxjp/jg4;'s other methods (a/b/c/d/f — vcontroller/deleteMap,
vcontroller/uploadGtheme and the generic GET/POST helpers used by ~30 other
plugin classes) are copied into the shadow dex verbatim and keep working. This
mirrors why the base APK stubs the CONSUMER Lvho;->a rather than the URL
provider Ld80;->invoke: the literal holders Lxjp/x06;, Lxjp/gx9;, Lxjp/uk8; and
Lxjp/w7; are merged synthetics serving unrelated purposes app-wide (Lxjp/w7;
:pswitch_d returns "heartbeat/game/start" from a Function0 that also throws the
LocalAppAdaptiveInfo error and yields Compose/serializer values), so stubbing
them would corrupt unrelated resolution.

RETURN SHAPE. e() has no bail-out path of its own to copy, so the value was read
out of the three callers instead — all three provably tolerate null:

  start  (Lxjp/uk8;)  move-result-object v0; compared only against
                      COROUTINE_SUSPENDED, then overwritten with the kx9 ref.
                      The value is never read.
  update (Lxjp/x06;)  `check-cast p1, Lxjp/zy3;` (abstract ktor response) then
                      Result.constructor-impl(p1) and only exceptionOrNull-impl
                      is consulted. check-cast on null always succeeds, null is
                      a valid Result success value, exceptionOrNull is null, so
                      the error-log branch is skipped and the value is dropped.
  end    (Lxjp/gx9;)  compared only against COROUTINE_SUSPENDED, then dropped.

So `return null` is indistinguishable from a successful beat to every caller,
and no HTTP request, URL string or radio wake happens.

WHAT STAYS LOCAL. Only the network send is removed, exactly as the perf stub
does. The 30 s loop still runs and still writes elapsed seconds into MMKV under
the sha256("wine_usage:…") key (Lxjp/gx9; default branch and Lxjp/kx9;->f()),
kx9->a()/b()/c()/e() still resolve ids for local use, and the session Job
lifecycle is untouched — so nothing that reads local playtime changes
behaviour. (The in-app playtime SCREEN is already empty on this build: that is
the documented trade-off of the base getUserPlayTimeList stub in
apply_privacy_patches.py, not a new regression from this patch.)

===========================================================================

Both stubs are delivered through the SAME shadow-dex mechanism as the rumble
hooks, so the plugin's base.apk is never modified and its SHA-256 identity
record stays valid. Run this alongside apply_plugin_rumble_patches.py, before
build_plugin_shadow_dex.py.

# --- channel 1: device-performance session-summary uploader ----------------
#
# Every letter here drifts on a plugin bump (101 -> 102: uploader Lxjp/mv1; ->
# Lxjp/qv1;, result Lxjp/jv1; -> Lxjp/nv1;), and both stale letters still resolve
# to REAL classes in 102 — 102's mv1 is the "upload success" log lambda and its
# jv1 has an entirely different constructor. So nothing here is pinned by name.
#
# The uploader is located STRUCTURALLY, not by method letter. Plugins 101-106
# kept the pair as c(J…) upload + b(IJ…) retry, and pinning those two letters
# worked right up until plugin 107 renamed them to d(J…) + c(IJ…) and added an
# unrelated a(J…) (a read-only "load pending summaries" step under a timeout).
# A letter pin fails loudly at best; at worst a later shuffle lands the old
# letter on the wrong method of the same class.
#
# What has held across every plugin since 101:
#   * the upload is a `public final <x>(J…ContinuationImpl;)Object` method,
#   * the retry wrapper is a `public final <y>(IJ…ContinuationImpl;)Object`
#     method whose body calls <x> ON ITS OWN CLASS, and
#   * the class holds a field typed as the local summary repository (the class
#     carrying both "device_perf_session_summary_v1" and "readSummaryLocked").
# The retry -> upload self-call is what picks <x> out of several (J…) methods,
# and the repository field is what pins the class.
