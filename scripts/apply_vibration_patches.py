Apply PC-accurate vibration patches to a decompiled GameHub apktool tree.
Supports stock 6.0.9 only.

6.1.1: PARTIAL — winebus trigger only
-------------------------------------
GameHub 6.1.1 moved the PC/Wine engine out of the base APK into a
separately-downloaded plugin (com.xiaoji.egggame.plugin.pcengine, loaded via the
ComboLite framework's PluginClassLoader). In a 6.1.1 base APK:

  * lib/ no longer contains libwinemu.so / libxserver.so / libvfs.so
  * the com.winemu.* engine classes are gone; Lcom/winemu/core/gamepad/
    GamepadServerManager survives only as a gutted shell whose onRumble(III)V is
    `.locals 0 / return-void` and whose native methods were deleted
  * the features.winemu Compose resource bundle is gone
  * there is no Vibrator / CombinedVibration reference anywhere in the dex

So hooks 1-3 below (the onRumble entry point and the Physical dispatch/stop
methods) have no target and are NOT applied on 6.1.1 — restoring dual-motor
dispatch there needs the plugin dex patched, which is out of this script's
scope.

Hook 4 IS still applicable, and that matters: `winebus.so` did NOT move into the
plugin. Verified on-device (GameHub 6.1.1, versionCode 123): the Wine runtime is
still a downloaded component under the app's own files dir —

    files/usr/opt/wine_proton11.0-arm64x/...            <- winebus.so lives here
    files/usr/home/components/{Fex_*, dxvk-*, turnip_*, vkd3d-proton-*, ...}

which is exactly the tree BhVibrationController.ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce()
already walks, so the Java side needs no change. Only the TRIGGER moved: the
6.0.9 site was the EnvBuilder constructor, which is now plugin code. We inject
instead into the base APK's own
`PcEnginePluginHostActivity.onCreate(Bundle)` — host code that runs in the
`:pcengine` process on every game launch, before the plugin's Wine activity is
created and therefore before Wine starts.

Net effect on 6.1.1: **sustained rumble past SDL's ~1 s rumble_expiration is
restored**; dual-motor low/high split is not.

Hooks:

  1. GamepadServerManager.onRumble(III)V  — entry hook for the dispatcher
  2. <Physical>.h(II)V                     — per-controller rumble dispatch
  3. <Physical>.g()V                       — stop hook for keepalive cleanup
  4. <EnvBuilder>.<init>(Context,...) hook — call BhVibrationController to
                                             patch every winebus.so on disk
                                             once per app process (preload-
                                             free SDL rumble keepalive)

Per-version ProGuard rename maps are baked into RENAMES_6X below.

6.0.7 vs 6.0.4 drift baked into these anchors: R8 letters were fully
regenerated and .line debug directives are stripped from the app/obfuscated
code, so anchors are built from instruction sequences + method headers only
(no .line lines). The Physical class Lab8;->Lpz7; was re-lettered
(rumble g(II)V->h(II)V, stop f()V->g()V) and the per-vibrator list access
moved into a new accessor i()Ljava/util/List;, so the stop hook now anchors
on g()V's opener rather than the old inline k-field load. The EnvBuilder
Lbg5;->Liqn; (now in smali/, not smali_classes3/) no longer joins env vars
inline and no longer retains a Context at the join site, so the winebus
disk-patch trigger rides the EnvBuilder CONSTRUCTOR (where the live Context
is still in p1) instead of the joinToString call site.

Per-game settings UI insertion is intentionally out of scope (the 6.0.x
popup-menu architecture is Compose-based and Tencent's R8 obfuscation
makes the entry points hard to reach reliably). Global mode/intensity
work fine via BhVibrationSettingsActivity launched directly.

Usage:
    python3 apply_vibration_patches.py <apktool_decompile_dir>

Fails fast: if any anchor isn't found it exits non-zero before mutating
anything else.
