Apply privacy patches to a decompiled GameHub apktool tree. Supports stock
6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

6.1.1 -> 6.1.2 needed no new patches, only re-anchoring, and the anchors that
drifted were converted to structural locators rather than re-pinned:

  * locate_class() finds a class by text the compiler must keep — a Kotlin
    cast-failure message naming a model FQN, or the endpoint literal itself —
    instead of by filename. That covers the heartbeat start POST
    (Lvho; -> Lgio;), getUserPlayTimeList (Lby9; -> Lgy9;), the /events sender
    (Ll88; -> Lo88;) and the OTA URL assembler (Lej6; -> Lhj6;).
  * locate_method_containing() finds a method by what it CALLS, because the
    Firebase and Mob bootstraps in AndroidApp swap letters nearly every release
    (a() -> b() -> c() -> b()). On 6.1.2 b() is the *Mob* bootstrap, so the old
    hardcoded Firebase pin would have patched the wrong method rather than
    failing loudly — which is exactly why this is now derived.
  * the Mob push-config helper moved dex bucket as well as letter
    (smali_classes3/jku -> smali/mnu), so it is located by being the one
    APP-code caller of submitPolicyGrantResult, excluding the vendor SDK's own
    copies.

6.0.9 -> 6.1.1 is the largest drift this script has absorbed. Beyond the usual
R8 re-lettering and dex-count change (5 -> 4, so classes moved buckets again):

  * `.line` debug directives are BACK in app code (6.0.7-6.0.9 stripped them).
    Every multi-instruction exact-text anchor the old script used would fail on
    the interleaved `.line N` lines, so index-0 stubs now go in via
    prepend_to_method() (locate the method, insert after `.locals`) and invoke
    removals via remove_invoke_in_method() (locate by callee inside a method).
    Neither bakes a line number or a register into an anchor.
  * the network layer was rebuilt around repository suspend methods instead of
    per-endpoint SuspendLambdas, so the stubs return the repo's own Either
    success wrapper (Ldd7;) rather than a bare kotlin.Unit.
  * the XiaoJi heartbeat surface only LOOKS smaller: heartbeat/game/update and
    heartbeat/game/end are absent from the BASE APK, so two base stubs replace
    6.0.9's three. !!! THEY ARE NOT GONE — they moved into the PC-engine plugin
    and FIRED there (update every 30 s during play, log-confirmed), carrying the
    user's Steam ID64 as source_user_id. That plugin-side trio is killed by
    apply_plugin_privacy_patches.py (one stub at the shared bridge
    Lxjp/jg4;->e), not by this script. See the heartbeat note below.
  * the /events/device-performance-config channel left the BASE APK, so its
    6.0.9 stub is retired here — but it too moved into the plugin (endpoint
    literal .../events/device-performance-session-summary in Lxjp/n2;) and is
    killed there by apply_plugin_privacy_patches.py, not by this script.
  * NEW and NOT covered by this script: 6.1.1 added a Firebase Analytics
    logEvent mirror (base Lcr1;->b/c, plugin Lxjp/kz;) carrying device_id and
    gh_uid. 6.0.9 had zero app-code logEvent call sites. It should be inert
    because of the manifest kill-switch below, but the app calls
    setAnalyticsCollectionEnabled(true) plus consent grants on every startup
    (Ly6k;->a, log-confirmed "applyToSdk enabled=true"), so the manifest flag is
    now load-bearing for a live event stream rather than vestigial. Needs a
    pcap/DNS check against app-measurement.com to confirm the flag wins.
  * kotlin.Unit is no longer obfuscated, so `Lkotlin/Unit;->INSTANCE` resolves
    (6.0.7-6.0.9 needed the R8 letter Lx6m;->a).
  * the app class kept its name but its methods shifted again
    (Firebase bootstrap a() -> b(); Mob bootstrap b() -> c()).

Port of the bannerhub-revanced privacy patch set, translated from ReVanced
Kotlin/dexlib2 to apktool-tree text edits to fit this fork's Python+apktool
pipeline. The honest list of channels killed (and the ones knowingly left
in place) is mirrored from upstream PRIVACY.md so anyone running a DNS
recorder against the build can verify both halves.

What this kills
---------------

  Firebase Analytics (manifest meta-data kill switch)
    Adds firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated=true plus AD-ID/SSAID
    disables to <application>. Firebase SDK never initialises so no events
    reach app-measurement.com.

  Google Play Services Measurement (manifest android:enabled=false)
    Flips the three AppMeasurement* components off. GMS Measurement runs
    independently of Firebase Analytics and is unaffected by the meta-data
    kill switch above, so this complements it.

  Ad-ID permissions (manifest <uses-permission> strip)
    Removes the three declarations (AD_ID + the two AdServices perms) so
    privacy scanners don't flag the build as trackers-permission-requesting,
    and an OS-level permission audit no longer reports ad-tracking intent.

  Mob Push SDK (manifest android:enabled=false + bytecode init removal)
    Strips two invoke-statics in BaseAndroidApp.a() (the policy-grant gate
    + addPushReceiverInMain) and one in the obfuscated config helper
    nt5.N(Context)V (second policy-grant). Manifest layer flips every
    com.mob.* / cn.fly.* provider/service/receiver/activity to disabled,
    so Mob's ContentProvider auto-init can't fire even before the bytecode
    paths would.

  Chinese-OEM push fleet (manifest android:enabled=false + meta-data strip)
    6.1.1 newly registers the vendor SDKs behind Mob's push plugins —
    Xiaomi MiPush, Huawei HMS Push, Meizu, vivo — OUTSIDE the com.mob. /
    cn.fly. namespaces, so the 6.0.9 predicate left them all enabled.
    Several were exported, and com.xiaomi.mipush.sdk.
    NotificationClickedActivity was exported with NO permission (any
    installed app could launch it). All 13 are now disabled, and the
    OEM credential <meta-data> (Huawei appid, vivo api_key/app_id,
    HiHonor app_id, MIPUSH_SDK_VERSION_*) is stripped. See
    OEM_PUSH_COMPONENT_PREFIXES for the exact prefixes and for what is
    deliberately left enabled (generic HMS Core UI, AGConnect, FCM).

  XiaoJi heartbeat / playtime tracker (bytecode stubs)
    Lvho;->a stubs the surviving heartbeat/game/start POST (returning the
    Ldd7;(Unit) success wrapper its own early-out path builds) and Lby9;->e
    stubs the heartbeat/game/getUserPlayTimeList GET (returning an empty
    wrapped list). heartbeat/game/update and heartbeat/game/end are absent
    from the BASE APK, so two base stubs replace 6.0.9's three — but they are
    NOT gone: they live in the PC-engine plugin, where they fired every 30 s
    during play carrying the user's Steam ID64. That trio is killed plugin-side
    by apply_plugin_privacy_patches.py (shadow-dex stub at the shared bridge
    Lxjp/jg4;->e, the sole funnel for start/update/end). UX trade-off:
    the in-app playtime UI renders empty. Steam's own playtime on your Steam
    profile is unaffected (Steam tracks playtime independently via the
    Steam client running inside Wine).

  statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com /events (bytecode stub)
    Ll88;->a early-returns a synthetic success instance. Zero coroutine
    state machine, zero URL allocation, zero HTTP, zero radio wake. The
    perf-config sibling endpoint no longer exists in 6.1.1.

  XiaoJi OTA URL (bytecode register overwrite)
    The firmware-update URL is assembled at runtime ("https://" + host + "/"
    + "firmware/update/x1" via a 4-arg join helper) rather than being a single
    literal, and the host is branch-selected (www.xiaoji.com /
    ota-test.xiaoji.com). We overwrite the assembled-URL register with
    "http://127.0.0.1" right after the join, so the HTTP client fails with
    connection-refused regardless of which host branch was taken. JieLi
    gamepad-firmware native libs are also stripped from lib/*/.

What this deliberately doesn't touch
------------------------------------

  Firebase Crashlytics — the SDK settings-config probe to
    firebase-settings.crashlytics.com still fires on startup (vestigial
    init); upstream PRIVACY.md notes this is partial-gain-only and not
    worth the bytecode work in 6.0.4.
  Steam, GOG, Epic, anti-cheat — all out of scope. They run inside Wine
    and talk to their own vendors over their own network plane.
  bigeyes.com / steamstatic CDN — image-only fetches, no PII payload.

    Steam ID64. The owning plugin class is Lxjp/kx9; (WineGameUsageTracker,
    local MMKV key prefix "wine_usage:"), but its own methods only build the
    request DTO and resolve ids — the three POSTs are emitted from its suspend
    lambdas Lxjp/uk8; (start), Lxjp/x06; (update) and Lxjp/gx9; (end), all of
    which funnel through the static bridge Lxjp/jg4;->e(…Lxjp/fs9;…). That
    bridge is what apply_plugin_privacy_patches.py stubs, via the shadow dex.
    The URL-literal holders Lxjp/x06;/Lxjp/uk8;/Lxjp/w7; are merged synthetics
    serving unrelated purposes app-wide, so they are NOT stubbed — the same
    reasoning that makes us stub Lvho;->a instead of Ld80;->invoke here.

    What the two stubs below DO cover, in the base APK:

      Lvho;->a(String, Continuation)   the surviving heartbeat/game/start POST
      Lby9;->e(Continuation)           heartbeat/game/getUserPlayTimeList

    The network layer also changed shape: these are ordinary repository suspend
    methods now, not compiler-generated SuspendLambdas, so we early-return the
    repo's own success wrapper instead of a bare Unit.

    DELIBERATELY NOT STUBBED: Ld80;->invoke() holds the literal
    "heartbeat/game/start", but it is a merged constant/endpoint provider whose
    packed-switch also serves Compose composition locals and kotlinx
    serializers app-wide (:pswitch_e is the heartbeat case). Stubbing it would
    corrupt unrelated resolution — same trap 6.0.9 documented for Ln10. We
    stub its CONSUMER (Lvho;->a) instead, which is why that consumer was worth
    tracing through Loe0;->a rather than pattern-matching on the URL string."""
