/**
 * Prepends GameScrub's "shadow dex" to the PC-engine plugin's classloader so our
 * patched copies of the plugin's rumble classes win over the plugin's own.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * GameHub 6.1.1 moved the Wine/PC engine into a separately-downloaded plugin, so
 * the dual-motor dispatch hooks no longer have a target in the base APK. The
 * plugin APK is SHA-256-committed to a local identity record and re-verified on
 * every load, so patching it in place would mean forging that record.
 *
 * We don't touch it. ComboLite's PluginClassLoader extends DexClassLoader, whose
 * {@code dexPath} is a {@code :}-separated LIST searched in order. A single
 * base-APK injection at the head of
 * {@code PluginClassLoader.<init>(String pluginId, String dexPath, ...)}
 * (installed by scripts/apply_plugin_shadow_patches.py) routes that argument
 * through {@link #dexPath(String, String)} below, which returns
 *
 *     &lt;our shadow dex&gt;:&lt;the untouched plugin base.apk&gt;
 *
 * so base.apk stays byte-identical and its integrity check keeps passing. The
 * shadow classes can still call back into com.xj.winemu.* because
 * PluginClassLoader.loadClass falls back to super.loadClass (parent-first) on a
 * local miss.
 *
 * Safety gates — all of these fall back to the stock dexPath, i.e. stock rumble
 * behaviour, rather than risking a broken engine:
 *
 *   1. pluginId must be the PC-engine plugin. Other plugins are untouched.
 *   2. The installed plugin must be compatible. Our shadow classes are copies of
 *      a SPECIFIC plugin build's classes, and letting a stale shadow win over a
 *      newer plugin is exactly how you get NoSuchFieldError / verifier faults
 *      deep inside Wine. Two ways to satisfy this:
 *        a. its versionCode equals {@link #EXPECTED_PLUGIN_VERSION_CODE} (read
 *           from the host's own identity record) — that IS the build we were cut
 *           from, so there is nothing to check; or
 *        b. {@link #probeShadowCompatible} confirms at load time that every class
 *           we override still has the same shape in the installed plugin. The
 *           plugin contract has bumped on every base so far, so refusing on the
 *           version number alone meant losing dual-motor AND the plugin-side
 *           privacy stubs on every single release, usually needlessly.
 *   3. The asset must extract and be markable read-only (see below).
 *
 * Android 14+ requires dex files to be read-only before they can be loaded, so
 * the extracted shadow dex is chmod'd via {@link File#setReadOnly()} — the same
 * reason ComboLite leaves the plugin's own base.apk as {@code -r--r--r--}.

     * Why this exists: the plugin contract has bumped on every base so far
     * (schemaVersion 2/3/4/5 across 6.1.1/6.1.2/6.2.0/6.2.1), and each bump ships
     * a new plugin. A pure versionCode gate therefore refuses on every release —
     * which costs not just dual-motor but the plugin-side privacy stubs, because
     * they ride the same dex. Most of those bumps do not actually change the four
     * classes we override, so refusing was usually over-cautious. This checks the
     * thing we actually care about instead of a version number.
     *
     * What "safe" means here is narrow and deliberate: for every class in the
     * shadow, the plugin's same-named class must declare the SAME constructors,
     * methods and fields, and sit on the same superclass and interfaces. Exact
     * equality, not a subset:
     *
     *   - a member MISSING from the plugin means our copy references something
     *     that no longer exists;
     *   - a member ADDED by the plugin is just as fatal, because our copy REPLACES
     *     the class wholesale, so any caller of the new member would hit a
     *     NoSuchMethodError against our older copy.
     *
     * This directly targets the failure the version pin was protecting against:
     * on plugin 102 the letter `fi3` stopped being the Physical vibrator and
     * became an unrelated kotlinx serializer, and `jv1` kept its name but changed
     * constructor. Both are caught here as shape mismatches, by name, without
     * knowing anything about what those classes are supposed to be.
     *
     * Cost: one throwaway DexClassLoader over the plugin APK. Classes are loaded
     * with initialize=false so no static initialiser runs. The verdict is cached
     * per plugin SHA-256, so this happens once per plugin build rather than once
     * per launch — see {@link #compatCacheFile}.
